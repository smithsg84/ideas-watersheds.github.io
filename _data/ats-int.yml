description: "A code for solving ecosystem-based, integrated,
  distributed hydrology.  It builds on the multi-physics framework and
  toolsets (mesh infrastructure, discretizations, solvers) provided by
  Amanzi and is a key driver of development of the flexible
  multiphysics framework Acros. Capabilities are largely based on
  solving various forms of Richards equation coupled to a surface flow
  equation, along with the needed sources and sinks for ecosystem and
  climate models.  This can (but need not) include thermal processes
  (especially ice for frozen soils), evapo-transpiration,
  albedo-driven surface energy balances, snow, biogeochemistry, plant
  dynamics, deformation, transport, and much more. It is unique in its
  thermal integrated hydrology capabilities, which includes thermal
  energy with freeze/thaw processes in both the surface and subsurface
  water, and its reactive transport capabilities, which are also
  coupled in both surface and subsurface water.  ATS is jointly
  developed by LANL, LBNL, and ORNL as an open source project under
  the three-clause BSD license."

capabilities_provided: "e.g., PFLOTRAN is a Subsurface Flow and Reactive Transport Code"
capabilities_shared: "e.g., PFLOTRAN shares geochemistry, ParFlow shares PF-CLM"
capabilities_used: "e.g., ATS uses PFLOTRAN and CrunchFlow Geochemistry through Alquimia"
